## ðŸ“ˆ ()[Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction]

Our first project focuses on predicting the recurrence of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer using a comprehensive dataset. Here's what we've achieved so far:

- **Data Completeness**: ðŸš« No missing data ensures a solid foundation for our models.
- **Features**: ðŸ“Š Mostly categorical (except 'Age')
- **Model Performance**: ðŸŽ¯ 100% accuracy with Random Forest
- **Key Insights**: ðŸ”‘ The most important features are 'Response', 'Risk', 'N' {Node}, 'T' {Tumor}, 'Age', 'Adenopathy', and 'Stage'.
- **Feature Importance**: Top 7 features gets us to 100% accuracy
