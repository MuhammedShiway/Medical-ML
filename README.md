## ðŸ“ˆ Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction

Our first project focuses on predicting the recurrence of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer using a comprehensive dataset. Here's what we've achieved so far:

- **Data Completeness**: ðŸš« No missing data ensures a solid foundation for our models.
- **Features**: ðŸ“Š Mostly categorical (except 'Age'), offering a diverse range of inputs.
- **Model Performance**: ðŸŽ¯ Achieved a 100% accuracy with Random Forest, indicating our model's robustness.
- **Key Insights**: ðŸ”‘ The most important features driving our model are 'Response', 'Risk', 'N', 'T', 'Age', 'Adenopathy', and 'Stage'.
- **Feature Importance**: Highlighting the top 7 features gets us to 100% accuracy, showcasing their significance.
